# Programming Meme Generator

This project is a simple web application that generates programming-related memes using the Programming Memes API. The application displays a random meme along with its ID. You can generate a new meme by clicking the "Generate Meme" button.

## Features
- Fetches memes from the Programming Memes API (`https://programming-memes-images.p.rapidapi.com/v1/memes`)
- Displays the meme image and ID
- Refreshes with a new meme upon button click

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the basic structure of the page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the HTML elements.
- `meme.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the API calls and dynamic content updates.

## How It Works
1. The application fetches a random programming meme from the Programming Memes API.
2. The meme's image and ID are displayed on the page.
3. Clicking the "Generate Meme" button triggers a new API call to fetch a different meme.
